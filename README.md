## Instructor: [Ashraff Hathibelagal][instructor url]

Google Play store has dozens of camera apps - each of them enabling a different way to take photos, or doing something unique with the pictures from the camera. Have you ever wondered what goes into creating such an app? What APIs are involved? This course will answer those questions!

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Ashraff Hathibelagal will show you how to create an Android app that allows users to take photos and apply image filters to them. You'll use the Camera2 API, introduced in Android Lollipop, to create a live camera preview and capture high resolution still pictures. The Camera2 API expects you to manage a lot of low-level details yourself. Therefore, you'll also learn how to control the state of the auto-focus and auto-exposure algorithms of an Android device's camera hardware. Furthermore, you'll learn how to store the photos on external storage media, such as SD cards. Towards the end of this course, you'll also learn to use the Android GPUImage library to apply several commonly used image filters, such as sepia, grayscale, and toon, to the photos.
