## Instructor: [Ashraff Hathibelagal][instructor url]

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Ashraff Hathibelagal shows you how to create an Android app that allows users to take photos, and apply image filters to them. You're going to be using the Camera2 API, introduced in Android Lollipop, to create a live camera preview, and capture high resolution still pictures. The Camera2 API expects developers to manage a lot of low level details. Therefore, you'll also learn how to control the state of the auto-focus and auto-exposure algorithms of an Android device's camera hardware.

Furthermore, you'll learn how to store the photos on external storage media, such as SD cards. Towards the end of this course, you'll use the Android GPUImage library to apply various Instagram-like filters to the photos.
